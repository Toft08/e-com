# Buy-01 E-commerce Platform

A full-stack e-commerce platform built with **Spring Boot microservices** and **Angular**. This platform supports user registration as clients or sellers, authentication, product CRUD functionality exclusively for sellers, and media management for product images.

## Features

### Backend (Spring Boot)
- **User Management**: Registration as client or seller with JWT authentication
- **Product Management**: CRUD operations for products (seller-only)
- **Media Management**: Image upload with 2MB size limit and file type validation
- **Role-based Authorization**: CLIENT and SELLER roles with appropriate permissions
- **Security**: BCrypt password hashing, HTTPS support, JWT tokens with HttpOnly cookies
- **Database**: MongoDB with proper relationships between User, Product, and Media entities

### Frontend (Angular)
- **Authentication**: Login/Register forms with role selection
- **Home Page**: Featured products display with responsive design
- **Product Browsing**: Public product listing with images
- **Seller Dashboard**: Product management interface (planned)
- **Media Upload**: Image management for products (planned)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface

## Prerequisites

- **Java 17+**
- **Node.js 18+** 
- **Maven**
- **MongoDB** (local or Docker)
- **Angular CLI** (optional but recommended)

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd buy-01
```

### 2. Backend Setup

#### Start MongoDB
```bash
# Using Docker (recommended)
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo

# Or use local MongoDB installation
```

#### Configure and Run Spring Boot
```bash
cd backend

# Make Maven wrapper executable (if needed)
chmod +x mvnw

# Build and run the application
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The backend will be available at: `https://localhost:8443`

#### SSL Certificate
The application uses HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. In your browser:
1. Navigate to `https://localhost:8443`
2. Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to localhost" to accept the certificate

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

The frontend will be available at: `http://localhost:4200`
